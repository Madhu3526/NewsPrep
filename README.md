In the age of information overload, efficiently extracting and utilizing relevant news content for educational purposes poses a significant challenge. This project presents an AI-driven system that automatically generates multiple-choice questions (MCQs) from real-time news articles to support competitive exam preparation. Leveraging the NewsAPI, the system fetches current articles related to key domains such as national affairs, economy, science, and general awareness. It then applies a series of Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning techniques to convert this unstructured data into structured, quiz-ready content.
The workflow begins with news summarization using the t5-base transformer model to distill lengthy articles into concise, informative summaries. Keyword extraction is performed using KeyBERT with a sentence transformer backend, identifying key concepts suitable for question generation. The t5_squad_v1 model is then used to frame context-relevant questions from these keywords. To ensure a high-quality quiz experience, distractor options are generated using a combination of Sense2Vec and WordNet, and further refined using Levenshtein distance to avoid semantic overlap.
This system bridges the gap between real-time information and personalized learning. It offers a scalable, automated approach to help students revise current affairs through dynamically generated quizzes, enhancing engagement, retention, and exam readiness.
